## ðŸ’» Image Generation with Diffusers
This Streamlit app allows you to generate images based on text prompts using the Diffusers library. The app leverages the power of pre-trained models to create images from textual descriptions.


### Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Enter a text prompt, and the app generates an image based on the description.
GPU Support: Automatically uses GPU if available for faster inference.
